General description or introduction of the problem and your solution:<br>
&emsp;This midterm project, I implemented binary search algorithm for TLM platform and HLS. Binary search is a divide and conquer algorithm to find a specific value in a sorted array. I decomposed the project into software and hardware parts, the software part is the testbench and the hardware part is the binary search hardware I implemented. The hardware part of binary search is implemented as 8 numbers array binary search. For simplicity, I use a char variable to store input array size, thus, the input size has maximum number 255, so the input array size can be 1 to 255. Of course, the input size can be larger by some small changes in the source code. The input and output example is as following:<br>

Implementation details (data structure, flows and algorithms):<br>
&emsp;Since the input size can be customizable, and the hardware part for binary search is designed for 8 numbers bianry search. So, when the input size is larger than 8 numbers, the input array will be separated into different sets with fixed size 8 numbers in order to fit the hardware. The input array is decomposed into a fixed-sized slice (8 numbers) and store it locally in the hardware module to do the binary search algorithm. For testbench part, the input array will be transfer to hardware module in order of sets. Also, the total array size will be sent to hardware part to calculate how many iterations are needed. For the hardware part, 8 numbers of binary search will be done every iteration and after all iterations are finsihed, hardware module will transfer whether the value is found and if so, what are its index. In TLM part, the operation can transfer to the kernel hardware via register interface (memory map).<br>
